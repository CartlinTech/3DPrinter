# Cartlin Tech 3D Printer
Most 3D printers these days seem to either cater for large industrial applications that have deep pockets or are competing to keep costs as low as possible.
This leaves many users buying both a cheap printer and a bunch of upgrades at the same time in order to get something they are happy with.

Cartlin wants to cut out the wasted part and engineer a machine that is both affordable (for what it is) while including optimal components that donâ€™t instantly need upgrading.

## Why such a restrictive license?
Firstly as a commercial company sinking a lot of time into a project, we are happy for individuals to make use of our acomplishments however we don't want people making a profit off our hard work.
In regards to "no derivatives", we welcome ideas and contributions to this project to make it better for everyone and feel that a thousand forks that never push anything back to the main project isn't helpful. Have a use case that you feel falls outside the license feel free to have a chat with us and we will see if we can accomodate it.

## Where to begin?
At the moment nowhere, we are in the process of planning and prototyping which means documentation is being written and then rewritten as plans change, things fail and get reworked.
If you want to get involved with suggestions, features you think are must haves, turning our scribbles into coherent documentation etc. then send us a message to dev@cartlin.com
